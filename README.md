### Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to ensure existing and future iOS and Mac products conform to a consistent and well-designed convention. This will make applications easier to build and debug for both newcomers and existing members alike. In this document, we'll be using Shopify (aka Jaded Pixel) as an organization name, but the same rules can apply to any organization, even if for solo developers.

Many of the conventions in this guide are common to existing Cocoa style guides (see the References section below), and try to combine the best of those worlds.

This document also strives to include the best and most modern features of the Objective-C language, Cocoa frameworks, and the iOS SDK in general, so that excessive baggage does not creep in. As the environment evolves, so too must this guide.
